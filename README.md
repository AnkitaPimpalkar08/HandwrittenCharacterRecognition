# Handwritten Character Recognition (HCR) Using a Neural Network

This project implements a Handwritten Character Recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is designed to classify handwritten characters (e.g., English letters) using the MNIST dataset as a baseline demonstration, which can be easily extended to other datasets like EMNIST for a broader character set.

## Project Overview
The main aim of this project is to build a neural network that can recognize handwritten characters effectively. The system uses a CNN model trained on image data, preprocessed and augmented to enhance generalization capabilities.

## Dataset
- **Default Dataset**: MNIST (28x28 grayscale images of digits 0-9). This project can be adapted to other datasets like EMNIST (for letters).
- **Data Preprocessing**: Images are normalized to a [0, 1] range and reshaped to include a channel dimension.

## Model Architecture
The model consists of multiple layers:
- Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- MaxPooling layers
- Dropout for regularization
- Dense layers for classification
- Softmax activation in the final layer for class probabilities

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/HandwrittenCharacterRecognition.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd HandwrittenCharacterRecognition
    ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the training script:
    ```bash
    python hcr_model.py
    ```
2. The trained model will be saved as `best_model.keras`.
3. You can visualize training results such as accuracy and loss using the plots generated.

## Results
- Training and validation accuracy/loss plots will be displayed after training.
- The trained model can recognize handwritten characters with reasonable accuracy based on the dataset used.

## Future Improvements
1. Use a custom dataset for English characters (e.g., EMNIST).
2. Add explainability features using SHAP, LIME, or other tools.
3. Introduce more sophisticated data augmentation techniques.
4. Implement domain-specific rules for improved recognition performance.
