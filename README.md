Handwritten Character Recognition Project
Overview
This project focuses on building a Handwritten Character Recognition system using deep learning and TensorFlow. The goal is to recognize handwritten characters with high accuracy and efficiency, leveraging a trained model that processes input data, performs predictions, and outputs the recognized characters.
Features
•	• Model Training: Trained using a deep learning model built with TensorFlow/Keras.
•	• Data Preprocessing: Includes cleaning, normalization, and transformation of input data for better training performance.
•	• Prediction: Capable of predicting handwritten characters based on input images.
•	• User Interface: A basic interface for uploading handwritten images for recognition (if applicable).
Installation
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Virtual environment tools like `venv`
- Git
Setup Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnkitaPimpalkar08/HandwrittenCharacterRecognition.git
   cd HandwrittenCharacterRecognition
   ```
2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
Usage
Training the Model
1. Place your dataset in the appropriate data directory.
2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
Recognizing Characters
1. To recognize characters using a trained model, run:
   ```bash
   python recognize.py --input <image_path>
   ```
User Interface (if applicable)
If you have a user interface for uploading handwritten images, follow the instructions provided in the UI module directory or documentation.
Project Structure
